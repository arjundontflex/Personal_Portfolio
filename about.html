            I am Jampana Venkata Arjun Varma, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology
            in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence
            and Machine Learning at Presidency University, Bangalore. I have always sought to
            apply my academic learning to solve real-world challenges, and I am now eager to
            further extend my knowledge through research internships that will provide hands-on
            experience in cutting-edge technologies.
